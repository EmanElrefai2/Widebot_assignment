### Challenges Faced:
- Data Preprocessing for Arabic NER:
Arabic text processing involves unique challenges, including dealing with different script variations, and morphological complexities.

- Limited Labeled Data:
Availability of labeled data for Arabic NER might be limited, making it challenging to train robust models.

- Handling Unbalanced Data:
Imbalanced class distribution in NER data can affect model performance, especially for less frequent entities.

### In your opinion, what is the best approach to handle much larger number of entities like 100?

- Entity Embeddings:

Represent entities as embeddings in a continuous vector space. This allows the model to capture semantic relationships between entities, even when dealing with a large number of them.

- Grouping Similar Entities:

Group similar entities together to reduce the number of distinct labels. This can be based on semantic similarity, entity type, or any other relevant criteria.
